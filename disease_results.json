  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Symptoms of late blight include the appearance of dark, water-soaked spots on leaves, which rapidly enlarge and may be accompanied by a white, cottony growth on the undersides. Stems and fruits can also be affected, leading to significant yield losses if not controlled.",
  "remedies": "Natural: Remove and destroy infected leaves and fruit promptly. Apply copper-based fungicides or neem oil weekly as a preventative. Ensure good air circulation. Chemical: Use protectant fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb preventatively, rotating with systemic fungicides like mefenoxam or protectants like fluazinam if disease appears. Follow label instructions carefully. Prevent: Select disease-resistant tomato varieties. Practice crop rotation, avoiding planting tomatoes in the same area for at least three years. Avoid overhead watering to reduce leaf wetness and humidity.",
