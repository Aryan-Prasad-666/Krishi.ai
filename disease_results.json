  "disease": "Powdery mildew",
  "plant": "Cherry",
  "symptoms": "Powdery mildew is characterized by white or gray powdery spots on the surfaces of leaves, stems, and sometimes fruits. These spots can expand to cover large portions of the plant. Severely affected leaves may turn yellow or brown and eventually die.",
  "remedies": "Natural: Prune infected areas to improve air circulation. Apply neem oil or potassium bicarbonate spray weekly. Chemical: Use myclobutanil or sulfur-based fungicides, following label instructions, especially during humid conditions. Prevent: Plant cherry varieties with powdery mildew resistance. Ensure good air circulation by proper spacing and pruning. Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity. Regularly monitor plants for early signs of infection and act promptly.",
